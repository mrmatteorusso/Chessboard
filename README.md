# Chessboard
I have found this exercise a good challenge and I would like to share it!

Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline
characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space
or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.
Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

\# # # #<br>
 \# # # #<br>
\# # # #<br>
 \# # # #<br>
\# # # #<br>
 \# # # #<br>
\# # # #<br>
 \# # # #<br>

When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size
= 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid
of the given width and height.

## Comments
A part from the usual use of a decent amount of logic to solve the puzzle, it was interesting to use the operator `+=` and how to deal with the for loops.
There are other option for sure and maybe .forEach() is the easiest one to think of.
